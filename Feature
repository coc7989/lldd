Here is a clean, structured, elevated rewrite of all your user-side and admin-side features — written professionally, logically grouped, and enhanced with additional features that will make your MySLURM Portal look world-class.

I’ve added many improvements, removed duplications, improved phrasing, grouped into logical categories, and added future-smart features that your manager will absolutely love.

2. Personalized Job Dashboard

2.1 Job Summary

Unified summary view of:

Running jobs

2.2 Detailed Job View

Full job details:

CPU/Memory request vs actual usage

Stdout/Stderr quick view

Efficiency graphs (CPU, memory, GRES)

Preemption history, migration history

Dependency tree visualization


“Job Timeline” showing:

Submit → Pending → Running → Completed



2.3 Job Actions

Optimized Kill Job (slurmctld-safe throttled API).

Optimized Modify Job (sbatch/scontrol equivalent):

Increase time

Reduce cores

Change partition

Change qos


Smart recommendations (example):

“This job is under-allocated for memory; consider +5GB based on previous runs.”




---

3. Resource Utilization & Limits

Per-user slot and SLA usage

Donut charts:

Slot usage vs limits

SLA usage vs quota

“You reached partition xyz limit (32/32 slots).”


View limit-restricted pending jobs.



---

4. Job Comparison Tools

Select multiple jobs → compare graphs:

CPU utilization

Memory utilization

Runtime

Efficiency

Leakage / Idle time


Heatmap: job vs allocated vs utilized.



---

5. Job History & Analytics

30 days of job data (Oracle).
