Below is a fully detailed, hierarchical site map for your mySLURM User Experience Dashboard formatted for Relume (clear parent–child structure, page hierarchy, components, and modal-level interactions).
I’ve separated User-facing, Admin-facing, and System-level pages.
You can directly paste this into Relume or use it to build a component library.
