Below is a structured, executive-ready write-up that positions mySLURM as a new, forward-looking platform, not a re-skin of myLSF, while explicitly emphasizing user experience, LSF→SLURM transition enablement, MCP-driven interaction, and job prediction intelligence.

I’ve written it in a way that you can directly use it for:

mySLURM Portal – Proposal & Vision

1. Description / Problem Statement

As our compute infrastructure transitions from IBM LSF to SLURM, users—especially designers and power users with decades of LSF experience—face a steep learning curve. SLURM offers powerful scheduling and scalability benefits, but its command-line–centric interaction model, lack of intuitive feedback on job behavior, and limited predictive insights create friction during adoption.

Key challenges today:

Users struggle to understand why jobs are pending, when they will start, or how efficiently they ran.

Resource over-requesting leads to cluster inefficiency, longer queue times, and wasted capacity.

Migrating users from LSF to SLURM requires mental model changes, not just command translation.

Operational teams spend significant time answering repetitive questions, debugging stuck jobs, and managing user misconfigurations.


mySLURM addresses these gaps by delivering a modern, intelligence-driven user experience that goes beyond traditional scheduler dashboards. It is not a duplicate of myLSF, but a next-generation portal designed specifically to unlock SLURM’s full potential while smoothing the human transition from LSF.

2. Business Value

A. Accelerated LSF → SLURM Adoption

Provides LSF-to-SLURM command translation, contextual explanations, and AI-assisted guidance.

Reduces resistance by allowing users to learn SLURM behavior visually and interactively, not via manuals.

Lowers dependency on tribal knowledge and one-on-one support.


Value: Faster migration timelines and reduced risk during coexistence phases.


---

B. Improved User Productivity & Experience

Single pane of glass for:

Cluster health

Job lifecycle visibility

Efficiency insights

Historical analytics


Predictive start-time and completion-time estimates remove guesswork.

MCP-based natural language queries reduce command-line friction.


Value: Users spend less time troubleshooting and more time designing and running workloads.


---

C. Higher Cluster Utilization & Cost Efficiency

Visibility into CPU/memory efficiency, over- and under-allocation.

Proactive alerts for bad resource requests and low efficiency jobs.

Data-driven decisions for future job submissions.


Value: Better utilization of existing hardware, delaying or reducing capital expansion.


---

D. Reduced Operational Overhead

Automated detection of:

Stuck jobs

Zombie processes

Memory leaks


Webex notifications reduce manual monitoring.

Self-service insights reduce tickets to HPC admins.


Value: Operations teams focus on optimization rather than firefighting.

Closing Positioning Statement

mySLURM is not a replacement for myLSF—it is a leap forward.
It redefines how users interact with schedulers by shifting from reactive command execution to predictive, guided, and data-driven decision making. By focusing equally on user experience, operational efficiency, and intelligent automation, mySLURM becomes a key enabler of our SLURM migration strategy and long-term compute efficiency goals.
